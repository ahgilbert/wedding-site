      <p>If you are so inclined, bring a tent and camp on the property Saturday night!  We have plenty of space for it. Come by the river house and set up before the ceremony</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Otherwise, book a room in Reedville, a five minute drive from the River house. Here are our favorites.</p>

      When you call to book, tell them you are with us. Many of the hotels in the area are holding rooms for our guests, and have agreed not to rent them to anyone else until about mid-April.  Don't wait til the last minute!
